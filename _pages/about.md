Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hao He (何昊). I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computer Software and Theory at Peking University, supervised by [Minghui Zhou](http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~zhmh/). Before that, I received my Bachelors' Degree on Computer Science in 2020.  My research interest is to address practical problems and interpret interesting phenomenons in the field of software engineering, using whatever methodology that helps, be it quantitative or qualitative. 

Besides that, I also love to make something cool by programming. I'm also a big game fanatic. I frequently try different kind of games, enjoy studying game mechanics, and from time to time I may get obsessed with and fascinated by one single game.
