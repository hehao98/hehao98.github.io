Welcome to my personal website! My name is Hao He(何昊), currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Peking University. I'm planning to pursue a PhD degree in Computer Software and Theory in Peking University since September 2020. For my detailed information please see below. For my projects you can refer to my [GitHub](https://github.com/hehao98) or check them at the projects panel of this website!

I love to make something cool by programming. I'm also a huge game fanatic. I frequently try different kind of games, enjoy studying game mechanics, and from time to time I may get obsessed with and fascinated by one single game (I'm currently studying how to defeat Japanese in east Asia in Heart of Iron IV...). Sometimes I also spend my leisure time making games. I'm not skilled enough to make an amazing one though!
