## Abstract

During software maintenance, developers may need to migrate an already used library to another library with similar functionalities. However, it is difficult to make the optimal migration decision with limited information, knowledge, or expertise. In this paper, we present MigrationAdvisor, a recommendation tool to objectively recommend library migration targets through intelligent analysis upon existing GitHub repositories. We have conducted systematic evaluations on the correctness of recommendations, and plan to evaluate the usefulness of our tool by collecting developer usage feedback in an industry context. An online introduction video is available at https://youtu.be/JZaVMWFfQO4
