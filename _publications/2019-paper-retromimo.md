## Abstract

We propose to design retroreflective MIMO channel based on polarization division multiplexing (PDM), with multiple LCD modulators and photodiode (PD receivers. LCD shutter works as a bi-state modulator which rotates the polarized light by 0 or 90. With polarizer on each side of LCD, it could retroreflect incoming light or absorb it. The retroreflected light is polarized to the angle of front polarizer, which is imperceptible by human eyes but could be separated using polarizer on PD receivers.
