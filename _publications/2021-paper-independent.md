## Abstract

While code comments are valuable for software development, code often has low-quality comments or misses comments altogether, which we call *suboptimal comments*. Such suboptimal comments create challenges in code comprehension and maintenance. Despite substantial research on suboptimal comments, empirical knowledge about why comments are sub- optimal is lacking, affecting commenting practice and related research. We help bridge this knowledge gap by investigating *independent comment changes*—comment changes committed in- dependently of code changes—which likely attempt to address suboptimal comments. We collect 23M+ comment changes from 4,410 open-source Java repositories and find that ∼16% of com- ment changes are independent, indicating a considerable amount of comments may be suboptimal. Our thematic analysis of 3,600 randomly sampled independent comment changes provides a two-dimensional taxonomy about what is changed (comment category) and how it changed (commenting activity category). We find some combinations of comment and activity categories have a relatively high frequency although those comments are *not* a large proportion of all comments; the reason may be that some comments easily become obsolete/inconsistent. By further inspecting extensive related materials for these independent comment changes, and validating it with a survey of 33 developer respondents, we find four reasons for suboptimal comments: belief in future actions, lack of comment guidelines, ineffective use of tools, and legacy. We finally provide implications for project maintainers, researchers, and tool designers.
