## Abstract

With the rise of open-source software and package hosting platforms, reusing 3rd-party libraries has become a common practice. Due to risks including security vulnerabilities, lack of maintenance, unexpected failures, and license issues, a project may completely remove a used library and replace it with another library, which we call library migration. Despite substantial research on dependency management, the understanding of how and why library migrations occur is still lacking. Achieving this understanding may help practitioners optimize their library selection criteria, develop automated approaches to monitor dependencies, and provide migration suggestions for their libraries or software projects. In this paper, through a fine-grained commit-level analysis of 19,652 Java GitHub projects, we extract the largest migration dataset to-date (1,194 migration rules, 3,163 migration commits). We show that 8,065 projects having at least one library removal and 1,564 (lower-bound) to 5,004 (upper-bound) projects have at least one migration, indicating the prevalence of library migrations. We find that projects with library removals have one removal per 139 commits, and projects with migrations have 2 to 4 migrations in median. We discover that library migrations are dominated by several domains presenting a long tail distribution. Also, migrations are highly unidirectional in that libraries are either mostly abandoned or mostly chosen in our project corpus. A thematic analysis on related commit messages, issues, and pull requests identifies 14 frequently mentioned migration reasons, 7 of which are not discussed in previous work. Our findings can be operationalized into actionable insights for package hosting platforms, project maintainers, and library developers.
