This is an interesting question from one of the lab assignments in Introduction to Computer Systems, fall 2018 at Peking University.

## Problem Description

Given a 32-bit integer $x$(in two's complement), implement a C function that returns $\frac{x}{6}â€‹$ using ONLY bit manipulations(operators like `~ ! | ^ & << >> +`). Your function should behave exactly as the C expression `x/6`.

Hint: You can use the following formula(*Formula 1*)

$$
2 = \frac{2+1}{2} \times \frac{2^2+1}{2^2} \times \frac{2^4+1}{2^4}\times\frac{2^8+1}{2^8}...
$$

## Inspiration
Since division is very slow using hardware, compilers often use optimizations to speed up division. For example, `gcc` will replace `x/6` with `x*171/1024` when x is relatively small, and implement `x*171/1024` with shift left and shift right instructions. However, our function must cover all 32-bit two's complement integers, which means some other techniques are needed to make such replacement possible.

## Resolution
We can change *Formula 1* into the following form:

$$
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{2^2+1}{2^2} \times \frac{2^4+1}{2^4}\times\frac{2^8+1}{2^8}...
$$

Thus we can calculate this(*Formula 2*)

$$
p = \frac{x}{8} \times \frac{2^2+1}{2^2} \times \frac{2^4+1}{2^4}\times\frac{2^8+1}{2^8} \times \frac{2^{16}+1}{2^{16}}
$$

Which can be implmented using a combination of shift-right and add operations(note that you must program carefully to avoid overflows). However, errors occur since expressions like `x>>y` return $\lfloor x/2^y \rfloor$. We can counter the error by this(*Formula 3*)

$$
\frac{x}{6} = p + \frac{x}{6} - p = p + \frac{1}{6}(x-6p)
$$

Since errors introduced by shift-rights will only cause $p$ to be smaller than $\frac{x}{6}$, we can deduce that $x-6p > 0$. You can then approximate an upper bound of $x-6p$, which depends on your implementation of *Formula 2*. 

Suppose that $x-6p < M$(where M is small), then we can approximate $\frac{1}{6}$ in *Formula 3* using some $X \approx \frac{1}{6}$ while keeping the equation true

$$
\lfloor \frac{1}{6} (x-6p)\rfloor = \lfloor X \cdot (x-6p) \rfloor
$$

Choose a proper $X = a/2^b$, and we are done!

 */
int divSix(int x) {
	int p;
	int q,y,t;
	x=x+(x>>31&5);
	p=x>>3;
	p=p+(p>>2);
	p=p+(p>>4);
	p=p+(p>>8);
	p=p+(p>>16);
	q=~p+1;
	t=x+(q<<1)+(q<<2);
	t=t+(t<<1)+(t<<3);
	return p+(t>>6);
}
```
