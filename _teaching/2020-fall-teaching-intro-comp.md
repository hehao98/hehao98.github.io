Introducton to Computation (C) is an undergraduate course at Peking University. It is an introductory course to programming for students majoring in literal arts (literature, foreign language, history, etc). 

I have made half of the exam questions from this very interesting [final exam](http://wjjc.openjudge.cn/2020jgcfallfinal/).

Tasks and responsibilities of course TA include:

* Participate in question answering and in-place programming sessions.

* Grading and providing feedbacks for programming assignments.

* Making up exam questions and organizing exams.
